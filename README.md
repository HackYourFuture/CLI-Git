# Module #1 - CLI and Git

Welcome to HackYourFuture! In this module we are going to go into two things that are maybe not as fun as building websites like you did in the application process, but are vital to your success as a developer: the command-line interface (CLI) and Git.

The command-line interface is a way for you to give commands to your computer using text rather than clicking, which will be used throughout your developer life. As you may have already guessed, it is much easier for any code you write to talk to the computer via defined commands rather than trying to navigate a user interface meant for humans. In this module we will give you a quick overview how to access the command-line interface and what commands you will use the most.

You'll also be learning Git, which is software that will allow you to save your folders and files in case they accidentally get deleted or end up corrupt. It is _the_ industry standard when talking about version control of your code and we will be using it all the time during the curriculum so that you become familiar with it.

## Learning goals

In order to successfully complete this module you will need to be able to do the following:

- Understand what a terminal is
- Know what markdown is and how to create a README
- Navigate the folders of your computer using the `command line interface (CLI)`
- Understand wat Git is used
- Use `GIT` commands and be able to:
  - Create a branch
  - Commit changes
  - Merge branches

## How to use this repository

This repository consists of 2 essential parts:

1. `README`: this document contains all the required theory you need to understand. It contains not only the right resources to learn about the concepts, but also lectures done by HackYourFuture mentors. This is the **first thing** you should start with every week.
2. `MAKEME`: this document contains the instructions for each week's homework. Start with the exercises rather quickly, so that you can ground the concepts you read about earlier.

## How to study

Let's say you are just starting out with HackYourFuture. This is the normal schedule...

1. The week always starts on **Wednesday**. First thing you'll do is open the `README.md` for that week. For the first week of `CLI-Git`, that would be [Week1 Reading](/Week1/README.md)
2. You spend **Wednesday** and **Thursday** going over the resources and try to get a basic understanding of the concepts. From the second week on, you'll also implement any feedback you got on last week's homework
3. On **Friday** you start with the homework, found in the `MAKEME.md`. For the first week of `CLI-Git`, that would be [Week1 Homework](/Week1/MAKEME.md)
4. You spend **Friday** and **Saturday** playing around with the exercises and write down any questions you might have
5. **DEADLINE 1**: You'll submit any questions you might have before **Saturday 23.59**, in the cohort channel
6. On **Sunday** you'll attend the Q&A session. It'll be of the Q&A format, meaning that there will be no new material. Instead your questions shall be discussed and you can learn from others
7. You spend **Monday** and **Tuesday** finalizing your homework
8. **DEADLINE 2**: You submit your homework to the right channels (GitHub) before **Tuesday 23.59**. If you can't make it on time, please communicate it with your supervisor
9. Start the new week by going back to point 1!

As this is the first week, we will not have homework that is due so luckily there is no DEADLINE 2, but keep it in mind as you will do as you get further into the curriculum.

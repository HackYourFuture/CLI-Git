## Week goals

All of the detailed information about every concept is in your study book. The following goal explanation will link you to the correct place to get studying. Read through the goal description once to get an idea of what you will be learning, then go through the different links (either from the agenda or this goal list).

This week is all about getting you started in the world of development. Building a website, using HTML/CSS is all very visual, but when it comes to modern web development there is a lot more abstract steps that need to happen. As a developer you will want to control the computer via commands so that you can automate certain steps. Don't worry about that too much, this week we will start with the basics: the CLI (Command Line Interface). Have a look at the item in your study book [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/cli/README).

Then let's go into [GIT](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/git-and-github/git) and [GitHub](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/git-and-github/github).Throughout the curriculum you will be using Git and GitHub to manage your source code. It is good to get familiar with this early as pretty much every developer team uses Git and most use GitHub.

Lastly let's learn a bit about [Markdown](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/git-and-github/markdown) as you will encounter it all over the place as well.
